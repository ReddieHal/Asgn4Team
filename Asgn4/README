No special instructions to compile just use mytar or all

Hope it works! Done as a partner project between Us.

Following was used during the project: Ignore
1. Sign into UNIX
2. run [ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" ] with your username
    -Press enter / DON"T CHANGE ANYTHING
3. go to home directory ("username/")
4. run cd .ssh
    this folder is hidden, use ls -a
5. cat [whatever.pub] copy it exactly
6. go to github settings and paste it
7. then run " ssh -T git@github.com " to check connection
8. go to directory you want the git clone to end up at.
9. go to github directory > code > ssh > copy the command there. (Starts with "git@github");
10. "git clone 'copypasted cmd'"
11. DONE

Working with GIT:
1. git pull - gets most recent update to main directory 
2. git commit / git commit -a - commits changes to later push
3. git push - push to directory
